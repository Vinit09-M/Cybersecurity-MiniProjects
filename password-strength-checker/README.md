# 🛡 Password Strength Checker

Simple Python script to check the **strength of a password** based on:
- Length (≥ 8 characters)
- Has at least one digit
- Has at least one uppercase letter
- Has at least one lowercase letter
- Has at least one special character

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Make sure Python is installed.
2. Run:
   ```bash
   python password_checker.py
   ```
3. Enter a password → It will print **Weak ❌, Medium ⚠️, or Strong 💪**.

## 📊 Example
```
Enter a password to check: Hello@2025
Password Strength: Strong 💪
```

## 🧠 Notes
This is a basic client-side checker. Real systems enforce policies on the server too.
